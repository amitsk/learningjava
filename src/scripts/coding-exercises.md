### Use Java to solve these exercises. Java8 will be easier and faster. Try both Java7 and Java8 to compare.

+ Create a List<Integer>  with an ArrayList implementation. In a loop from 1 to 100. Add every even number.
+ Using lambda expression, calculate the sum, average. Extract all multiples of 10 in another list.
+ Create another list which has all multiples of 7. Then create a list of all squares of this list.
+ Create a Set of type String. Use HashSet as an implementation. Add Strings - "This", "This","Test", "is" ,"a","Test","Of","Set"
+ What is the length of the set. Print out the length of every element.
