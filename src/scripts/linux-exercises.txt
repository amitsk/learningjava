Commmands to practice :
pwd, cd, chmod, chown, ls ( with the flags), rm , mkdir, tail, head, < , grep, |


Download this file uwing wget:
http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fdic-failed-bank-list/resource/608b288c-46bb-493c-a8ff-a2a0d05b51a0
wget http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.csv
Use the ls command to check if download worked. Look at file attributes -> ls -lrt. Ownership.

Print first 5 lines. Last 5 lines. Print the 2nd last line.

head -5 < banklist.csv
cat banklist.csv| head -5
cat banklist.csv | tail -5

Remove all the lines with leading quotes -> Use sed. Google for a sed one-liner
http://sed.sourceforge.net/sed1line.txt
# print only lines which do NOT match regexp (emulates "grep -v") : Regex is ^"
 sed -n '/regexp/!p'          # method 1, corresponds to above
 sed '/regexp/d'              # method 2, simpler syntax

sed -n '/^"/!p' < banklist.csv > banklist-scrubbed.csv

Sort the names of bank - ascending and then descending using the "sort" command.
Options : Try ascending and then descending. Try Ignore lowercase/uppercase
cut -d : -f 1,7 /etc/passwd

Print the last 5 and the first 5

Count the number of banks. use "wc -l"
Remove dups. Now count the number of banks. Use "uniq" command to remove dups

Run -> uniq banklist-scrubbed.csv| wc -l
Then Run -> wc -l banklist-scrubbed.csv

Why are counts same?

Print out the list of all States in the list. There should be only one record for each state.
The names should be sorted

cut -d , -f3 banklist-scrubbed.csv | sort -f | uniq

Get the list of all banks in AZ ( Use grep )
Count of all banks ( wc along with grep )


Compare the count in the 2 files : banklist.csv and banklist-scrubbed.csv : Do it manually for each file.


Now create a script that accepts the 2 files as arguments. Then prints the difference in the line counts

1 - Store the count of 1st file in a variable
2 - Store count of 2nd File in a variable
3 - Add them using an expression

Call script line count. It should error out if arguments are not 2.
